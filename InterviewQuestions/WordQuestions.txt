These are questions that I have asked and been asked in interviews

1. You have 3 crates. 
	One crate is labeled apples. 
	One crate is labeled oranges. 
	One crate apples and oranges. 
	
	All of the crates are labeled wrong.
	With picking one item from any box how to you label each crate correctly?

	I would pick one fruit from the crate labeled "apples and orages". 
		If it an apple I would change the label to "Apples". 
		I know the "Oranges" crate is labeled wrong. I would change the label to "Apples and oranges"
		I know the "Apples" crate is labeled wrong. I would change the label to "Oranges"
